## **Experience**

### **BTheChange** — Research Science Assistant  
*Dec 2022 – Present*  
- Developing an Interactive Programme to address the lack of formal climate change education in Europe.
- Collaborate with international researchers on an Erasmus Plus KA2 Higher Education project.
- Utilized NLP (sentiment analysis, emotions analysis) to analyse user comments on YouTube videos.
- Conducted data analysis to discover which videos portray an effective message on climate change.

### **The Awareness Company** — Junior Data Scientist  
*Sep 2022 – July 2023* — Johannesburg, South Africa  
- Worked collaboratively in a cross functional engineering team on an AI-powered data storytelling platform.
- Used data analysis to investigate the robustness of Machine Learning models to maximise their performance and robustness, including a computer vision model (using  Azure Computer Vision and Custom Vision Cognitive Services) to identify animals, people, and cars and an energy demand model to predict energy usage in buildings.
- Designed, trained, and deployed custom ML models to solve real-life challenges including a time-series soil moisture predictor and a poaching predictor capable of identifying high-risk areas for poaching in the Kafue National Park, Zambia.
- Utilized Azure OpenAI Service to fine-tune a state of the art LLM-based chatbot with company-specific data for deployment and hosting to end users via an API.

### **Tesserae** — Junior Full-Stack Software Engineer  
*Feb 2022 – Aug 2022* — Johannesburg, South Africa  
- Worked in an engineering team of five people on a Full stack AI annotation platform used to provide business intelligence in the FinTech industry.
- Worked on both the frontend (React) and backend (Django) to design, develop, and deploy user-facing features.
- Built an end-to-end testing infrastructure in Python using Cypress and created a bot to enable WhatsApp annotation, deployed using AWS Lambda functions.

### **LearnTech** — Software Development Intern  
*Dec 2019 – Jan 2020* — Johannesburg, South Africa  
- Worked as part of a four-person team tasked with developing a gamification application.
- Learned database querying using PHP MySQL and Git for source control.

## **Projects**

### **Masters Thesis**: *Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Interpretability*  
- Utilized the TRL library to take a groundtruth reward model and fine-tune open source Pythia LLMs (70M and 410M parameters) using RLHF to reduce the toxicity of the models.  
- Developed a novel max-margin Inverse Reinforcement Learning algorithm applied to LLMs to extract the reward model from the fine-tuned LLMs. Found that IRL can effectively extract reward models that closely approximate the original RLHF objectives. The accuracy of the algorithm reached 80.40\%.
- Analysed the results and showed that normal correlation metrics were insufficient for assessing viability for this application. Other techniques including policy comparison were done to show IRL proficiency.
- Using the IRL reward model to fine-tune an LLM results in a lower toxicity than the original RLHF process. Therefore, not only does the work enhance interpretability but also alignment with human values.

### **Bachelors Thesis**: *Quantifying the Effectiveness of Speeches on Climate Change*  
- Used Natural Language Processing to develop a method capable of quantifying the effectiveness of speeches on climate change by analysing user comments.
- Leveraged NLTK for text preprocessing and feature engineering, followed by developing an ensemble of machine learning models in scikit-learn, achieving 82.35\% classification accuracy.
- Analyzed key factors contributing to the video effectiveness, including participant profiles and video formats.
